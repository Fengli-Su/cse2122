Starting 2014 fall, I have decided to put the games designed by my students online. 
I know, I should have started doing this much earlier.
These are all text based games. This is not a game-design class more of a fun way to learn a bunch of new things.
Most of the students are not in Computer Science which makes it even more impressive. Enjoy.
